Then the sum of the divisors of $m$ is $1 + p + p^2 + p^3.$ For $p = 11,$ this value of $m$ is too low, and for $p = 13,$ the value of $m$ is too high; therefore, no prime $p$ gives a value of $n$ in the given set.\n\nTherefore, we must have $m = p \\cdot q$, for some distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ Then the sum of the divisors of $m$ is $1 + p + q + pq$, which we can factor as $(1+p)(1+q)$.

So we must have $m \\ge n$, so $m = n + ks$ for some $s \\ge 0$. But now $f(m + k) = f(n + k(s+1)) = m + k(s + 2)$. But $f(m + k) = n + k$, so $n = m + k(s + 1) > n$. Contradiction. \n\nSo if $f(m) = n$, then $m$ and $n$ have different residues $\\pmod k$. Suppose they have $r_1$ and $r_2$ respectively. Then the same induction shows that all sufficiently large $s \\equiv r_1 \\pmod k$ have $f(s) \\equiv r_2 \\pmod k$, and that all sufficiently large $s \\equiv r_2 \\pmod k$ have $f(s) \\equiv r_1 \\pmod k$. Hence if $m$ has a different residue $r \\mod k$, then $f(m)$ cannot have residue $r_1$ or $r_2$. For if $f(m)$ had residue $r_1$, then the same argument would show that all sufficiently large numbers with residue $r_1$ had $f(m) \\equiv r \\pmod k$. Thus the residues form pairs, so that if a number is congruent to a particular residue, then $f$ of the number is congruent to the pair of the residue. But this is impossible for $k$ odd.",

Substituting $x = 3$, we get $12 = -2A$, so $A = -6$.  Likewise, we plug in $x = 5$ to solve for $B$. Substituting $x = 5$, we get $20 = 2B$, so $B = 10$.  Therefore, $(A, B) = (-6, 10).$",
