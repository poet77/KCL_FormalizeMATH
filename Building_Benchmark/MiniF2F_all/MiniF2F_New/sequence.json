Thus, $P_n(0)=0$, $P_n$ is strictly increasing in $[0,+\\infty)$ , and $\\displaystyle \\lim_{x_1 \\rightarrow + \\infty} P_n(x_1)=+\\infty$. We can therefore define the inverse $P_n^{-1}$ of $P_n$ on $[0,+\\infty)$.

It follows that $b_n>b_{n+1},\\forall n$; and\n\nThus, $a_n<a_{n+1}<b_{n+1}<b_n, \\forall n$. Therefore, the two sequences $\\{a_n\\}_{n=1}^{+\\infty}$ and $\\{b_n\\}_{n=1}^{+\\infty}$ converge, and their limits $a$ and $b$ satisfy $a \\leq b$. Hence, $\\displaystyle \\bigcap_{n=1}^{+\\infty}(a_n,b_n)=[a,b]$ is non-empty, which demonstrates the existence of $x_1$.\n\nNow, suppose that $a \\leq x_1 \\leq x_1' \\leq b$.

However, $1-\\frac{1}{n}<x_n \\leq x_n'<1$, so that $0 \\leq x_n'-x_n<\\frac{1}{n}$, which implies that $\\displaystyle \\lim_{n \\rightarrow +\\infty}(x_n'-x_n)=0$.

    "informal_proof": "We need to find a pattern in $T$ first. You may have heard of it by the name Fibonacci sequence. Reduced modulo $7$ (we can still use the recurrence relation), it looks like \\[T\\equiv \\{0,1,1,2,3,5,1,6,0,6,6,5,4,2,6,1,0,1\\ldots\\}.\\]The first $16$ terms are $\\{0,1,1,2,3,5,1,6,0,6,6,5,4,2,6,1\\}.$ As the next two are $0$ and $1$ and since the sequence is defined by recursion on the most recent two terms, the Fibonacci sequence modulo $7$ consists of repetitions of $0,$ $1,$ $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ $1,$ $6,$ $0,$ $6,$ $6,$ $5,$ $4,$ $2,$ $6,$ $1.$ Now \\[\\begin{cases}\na\\equiv 5\\pmod {16}\\implies t_a\\equiv 5\\pmod 7\\\\\nb\\equiv 10\\pmod {16}\\implies t_b\\equiv 6\\pmod 7\\\\\nc\\equiv 15\\pmod {16}\\implies t_c\\equiv 1\\pmod 7\n\\end{cases}~.\\]Thus, $$t_a+t_b+t_c\\equiv 5+6+1\\equiv 12\\equiv 5\\pmod 7.$$",
