For example, if Karl was born 200 years ago, Johann could have been born anywhere between 300 and 100 years ago. Let 500 years equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This will be equal to $2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{16}{25}$.  So, the area of the shaded region is $1-\\frac{16}{25}=\\frac{9}{25}$.  Since the area of the square is 1, this is also the probability that Karl and Johann were contemporaries. The answer, then, is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{25}}$.",
