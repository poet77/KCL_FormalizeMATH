We examine what happens to the last coin toss. Adding HH or TT is simply an identity for the last coin toss, so we will ignore them for now. However, adding HT or TH switches the last coin. H switches to T three times, but T switches to H four times; hence it follows that our string will have a structure of THTHTHTH.\nNow we have to count all of the different ways we can add the identities back in. There are 5 TT subsequences, which means that we have to add 5 T into the strings, as long as the new Ts are adjacent to existing Ts. There are already 4 Ts in the sequence, and since order doesnâ€™t matter between different tail flips this just becomes the ball-and-urn argument.

The ball 35 is the unique ball that is a multiple of both 5 and 7.\n\nIn total, there are $10+7-1 = 16$ balls whose number is divisible by 5 or 7.

        "problem": "Charles has two six-sided die. One of the die is fair, and the other die is biased so that it comes up six with probability $\\frac{2}{3}$ and each of the other five sides has probability $\\frac{1}{15}$. Charles chooses one of the two dice at random and rolls it three times. Given that the first two rolls are both sixes, the probability that the third roll will also be a six is $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.",

        "solution": "The probability that he rolls a six twice when using the fair die is $\\frac{1}{6}\\times \\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{1}{36}$. The probability that he rolls a six twice using the biased die is $\\frac{2}{3}\\times \\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{4}{9}=\\frac{16}{36}$. Given that Charles rolled two sixes, we can see that it is $16$ times more likely that he chose the second die. Therefore the probability that he is using the fair die is $\\frac{1}{17}$, and the probability that he is using the biased die is $\\frac{16}{17}$. The probability of rolling a third six is\n\\[\\frac{1}{17}\\times \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{16}{17} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{102}+\\frac{32}{51}=\\frac{65}{102}\\]Therefore, our desired $p+q$ is $65+102= \\boxed{167}$",
