Since $k$ is an integer, $4\\leq k \\leq 8$.  If $k = 4$, then we must have $r = 5$.  Otherwise, $r = 0,1,2,3,4,5$ are all allowable.  Thus we have a total of $\\boxed{25}$ possible values for $n$.",

Furthermore, we know that $2(x+2)=y+2$ since $x+2$ and $y+2$ represent the total number of kids in each of the two classes.
