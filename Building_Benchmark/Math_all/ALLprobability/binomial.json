        "solution": "We could solve this problem using casework, but using a little bit of symmetry and complementary probability gives us a more elegant solution. Since each coin flips heads and tails with equal probability, by the principle of symmetry the probability of getting more heads than tails is the equal to the probability of getting more tails than heads. Additionally, there are only three possible outcomes: getting more heads than tails, getting more tails than heads, or getting the same number of both. If we let $x$ represent the probability of the first outcome (which is the same as the probability of the second outcome) and $y$ represent the probability of the third outcome, we get the equation $2x + y = 1 \\Rightarrow x=\\dfrac{1-y}{2}$. So all we need to do is calculate the probability of getting the same number of heads and tails and we can then easily solve for what we want using the principle of complementary probability. Since there are two equally likely outcomes for each flip, there are a total of $2^8$ equally likely possible outcomes for flipping the 8 coins. We will have the same number of both heads and tails if we have exactly 4 of each, which we can count by selecting 4 out of the 8 flips to be heads which can occur in $\\binom{8}{4}=70$ ways. So $y=\\dfrac{70}{256}=\\dfrac{35}{128}$, and substituting that back into our first equation gives us the probability that we want: $x=\\boxed{\\dfrac{93}{256}}$.",

Then notice that the $k^{th}$ term of the expansion of $(10+2)^{25}$ is, by the binomial theorem, $\\binom{25}{k} \\cdot 10^{25-k} \\cdot 2^k$. Similarly, the $k^{th}$ term of the expansion of $(10-2)^{25}$ is, by the binomial theorem, $\\binom{25}{k} \\cdot 10^{25-k} \\cdot (-2)^k = (-1)^k \\cdot \\binom{25}{k} \\cdot 10^{25-k} \\cdot 2^k$, which is the same as the $k^{th}$ term of $(10+2)^{25}$ for $k$ even, and the negative of the $k^{th}$ term of $(10+2)^{25}$ for $k$ odd. So, if we add together the $k^{th}$ terms of the expansions of $(10-2)^{25}$ and $(10+2)^{25}$, we get double the value of the $k^{th}$ term of the expansion of $(10+2)^{25}$, that is, $2 \\cdot \\binom{25}{k} \\cdot 10^{25-k} \\cdot 2^k$, if $k$ is even, and 0 if $k$ is odd.

But notice that this is divisible by 100 for $k<24$, and because we care only about the remainder when dividing by 100, we can ignore such terms. This means we care only about the term where $k=24$. This term is $$2 \\cdot \\binom{25}{24} \\cdot 10^1 \\cdot 2^{24} = 2 \\cdot 25 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 2^{24} = 500 \\cdot 2^{24},$$which is also divisible by 100. So, $8^{25}+12^{25}$ is divisible by 100. So the sum of the last two digits is $0+0=\\boxed{0}.$",

        "solution": "There are $\\binom{10}{3}=120$ ways to select exactly three dice to roll 1's ones out of ten dice total. The probability of any one of these outcomes occurring is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{5}{6}\\right)^7$ and they're all mutually exclusive cases, so the probability that one of them will occur (which is the probability that we're looking for) is $\\binom{10}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{5}{6}\\right)^7=\\dfrac{120\\cdot5^7\\cdot1^3}{6^{10}}\\approx \\boxed{.155}$.",
