        "solution": "All of the integers in the set $S$ have exactly one complementary number, $12-x$, such that their sum is 12, except for the number 6. Because $6+6= 12$, and the two numbers chosen are distinct, removing 6 will not eliminate any of the pairs that sum to 12, and it will reduce the total number of pairs possible. So $n=\\boxed{6}$.",
