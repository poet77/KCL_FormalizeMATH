If, however, the first roll is a $3$ or a $4,$ in each case there will be two rolls that satisfy the given condition- $1$ or $5$ and $2$ or $6,$ respectively. This gives us another $4$ successful combinations for a total of $8.$\n\nSince there are $6$ possible outcomes when a die is rolled, there are a total of $6\\cdot6=36$ possible combinations for two rolls, which means our probability is $\\dfrac{8}{36}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}}.$\n\nOR\n\nWe can also solve this problem by listing all the ways in which the two rolls have a positive difference of $2:$ $$(6,4), (5,3), (4,2), (3,1), (4,6), (3,5), (2,4), (1,3).$$  So, we have $8$ successful outcomes out of $6\\cdot 6 = 36$ possibilities, which produces a probability of $8/36 = 2/9.$",

Now we check that under no circumstance will 39 work. We see the optimal situation would be if we start with a leap year and end with a leap year.
