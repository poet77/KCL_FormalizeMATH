        "solution": "For a triangle to exist, the sum of two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third. Therefore, we have three formulas: $x^2+7>10 \\to x^2>3$, $x^2+10>7 \\to x^2>-3$, and $7+10>x^2 \\to x^2<17$. Thus, we have two quadratics, $x^2>3$ and $x^2<17$. Therefore, possible values for $x$ are $\\boxed{2, 3, \\text{ and } 4}$.",

        "solution": "We begin by expanding the left side: $$3x^2-4x \\le \\frac{6x^2 - 3x + 5}{10}$$\n\nThen we multiply both sides by 10 to clear denominators: $$30x^2-40x \\le 6x^2-3x+5$$\n\nRearranging, we have $24x^2 - 37x - 5 \\le 0$. The left-hand side can be factored, giving $(8x+1)(3x-5) \\le 0$. Thus, $8x+1$ and $3x-5$ have opposite signs (or are equal to zero). Then $-\\frac 18 \\le x \\le \\frac{5}{3}$, so $x = 0$ and $x=1$ are the $\\boxed{2}$ integer solutions.",

Putting these together, we have $2s \\ge f \\ge 6 +s/2$. The expression on the left end of this inequality chain must therefore be greater than or equal to the $6+s/2$ on the right, so \\[2s \\ge 6 + s/2 \\implies 3s/2 \\ge 6 \\implies s\\ge \\boxed{4}.\\]",

If $x+4<0$ (or $x<-4$), we have $-(x+4)<9$ which means $x+4>-9$ which yields $x>-13$. Thus, the solution is $-13<x<5$. Thus, the integers in this solution are -1 through -12 (12 integers), 1 through 4 (4 integers), and 0 (1 integer). Thus, the total is $12+4+1=\\boxed{17}$ integers.",
