JoAnn has drunk 2 ounces  of the 14 ounces  of coffee-cream mixture in her cup, so she has only $12/14 = 6/7$ of her 2 ounces  of cream in her cup.

To do this, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $8$ to both sides to get $pq - 4p - 2q + 8 = 10$. This can be factored into $$(p-2)(q-4)=10$$  We now can see that there are solutions only if $p-2$ divides $10$. Thus, there are $4$ possible values of $p$ between $1$ and $10$ inclusive $(1,3,4 \\text{ and } 7)$. It follows that the probability of picking such a $p$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",

The probability that she wins the game on her third turn is $1/32,$ and in general, the probability that she wins the game on her $k^\\text{th}$ turn is $(1/2)^{2k-1}.$ Thus, the probability that Alice wins is an infinite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/4.$ So, the probability that Alice wins the game is $$\\frac{\\frac12}{1-\\frac14} = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}.$$OR\n\nNote that the only difference between the odds of Alice or Bob winning is who goes first. Because Bob goes second, the odds of him winning on his $k^\\text{th}$ flip is half of the odds that Alice wins on her $k^\\text{th}$ flip, since Alice must first get a tails before Bob gets a chance to win. Thus, if $a$ is Alice's chance of winning, and $b$ is Bob's chance of winning, then $a = 2b.$ Also, since someone must win, $a + b = 1.$ It follows that $a = 2/3$ and $b = 1/3,$ so Alice has a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ chance of winning the game.",
